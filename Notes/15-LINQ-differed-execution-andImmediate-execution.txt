🔍 Deferred Execution vs Immediate Execution in LINQ (Super Simple Explanation)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These terms refer to when LINQ queries actually execute and retrieve data.


📌 1. Immediate Execution
____________________________

What is Immediate Execution?
The query runs immediately when it is defined.

Results are stored in memory right away.

Example: Methods like .ToList(), .ToArray(), .Count(), and .First() force execution.

Example of Immediate Execution:

var result = employeeList.Where(emp => emp.Annualsalary > 50000).ToList(); 

✅ The .ToList() method forces execution right away, and result stores all matching employees in memory.


📌 2. Deferred Execution
-------------------------

What is Deferred Execution?
The query does NOT execute immediately when written.

It only executes when you start iterating over the result (e.g., using foreach or calling .ToList()).

This saves memory and improves performance by only processing items when needed.

Example of Deferred Execution:

var result = employeeList.Where(emp => emp.Annualsalary > 50000); 

❌ No execution happens here! The query is just stored, not run yet.

Execution Happens When:

foreach (var emp in result)  // Now it runs
{
    Console.WriteLine(emp.FirstName);
}

✅ The query executes now when foreach starts iterating.


🚀 Key Differences
_____________________

Feature				Immediate Execution					Deferred Execution
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When does it run?		Instantly when called					Only when iterated over
Examples			.ToList(), .ToArray(), .Count(), .First()		.Where(), .Select(), .OrderBy()
Memory Usage			Higher (stores results in memory)			Lower (processes one item at a time)
Performance			Can be slower (if large data)				Faster (if we don't need all results)

🔹 Example Showing the Difference
____________________________________

Deferred Execution

var query = employeeList.Where(emp => emp.Annualsalary > 50000); 
Console.WriteLine("Query Defined.");  // No execution yet

foreach (var emp in query)  // Now execution happens
{
    Console.WriteLine(emp.FirstName);
}

✅ Output:

Query Defined.
(Execution starts)

Query is only executed when foreach starts.

Immediate Execution

var query = employeeList.Where(emp => emp.Annualsalary > 50000).ToList();  
Console.WriteLine("Query Executed.");  // Execution happens here

foreach (var emp in query)  
{
    Console.WriteLine(emp.FirstName);
}


✅ Output:

(Execution happens before foreach)
Query Executed.

Query executes immediately when .ToList() is called.



🚀 When to Use Which?
___________________________

✅ Use Deferred Execution for:

Queries that might change before execution.

Large datasets where not all items are needed.

Performance optimizations.

✅ Use Immediate Execution for:

When you need real-time count or results.

When you want to avoid multiple executions (caching results).
