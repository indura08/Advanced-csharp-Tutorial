ðŸ”¹ What is Environment.NewLine?
----------------------------------

Environment.NewLine is a built-in property in C# that gives you the newline character(s) specific to the operating system.

Syntax: Environment.NewLine


Returns: A string that represents a new line ("\n" or "\r\n" depending on the OS)

ðŸ”¹ How is it Different from Console.WriteLine?
------------------------------------------------

Both Environment.NewLine and Console.WriteLine can create new lines, but they are used differently:

âœ… Using Console.WriteLine

Console.WriteLine("Hello"); automatically moves to the next line after printing "Hello".

It works only when printing to the console.

âœ… Using Environment.NewLine

Environment.NewLine is just a string ("\n" or "\r\n") that represents a new line.
It can be used anywhere (not just in Console.WriteLine), such as logs, files, and UI elements.


ðŸ”¹ When Should You Use Environment.NewLine?
-----------------------------------------------

1. When you need new lines in variables or files:

string logMessage = "Error occurred:" + Environment.NewLine + "Invalid input.";
File.WriteAllText("log.txt", logMessage);


2. When working with multi-platform applications:
Windows uses "\r\n" (Carriage Return + Line Feed).
Linux & macOS use "\n" (Line Feed).
Environment.NewLine automatically picks the correct one for the OS.
