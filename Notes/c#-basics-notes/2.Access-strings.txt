this covers special string access methods :

Access Strings
You can access the characters in a string by referring to its index number inside square brackets [].

This example prints the first character in myString:

ExampleGet your own C# Server
string myString = "Hello";
Console.WriteLine(myString[0]);  // Outputs "H"

You can also find the index position of a specific character in a string, by using the IndexOf() method:

Example
string myString = "Hello";
Console.WriteLine(myString.IndexOf("e"));  // Outputs "1"
