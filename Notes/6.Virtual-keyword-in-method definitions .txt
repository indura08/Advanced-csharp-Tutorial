The virtual keyword in C# is used in a base class to allow a method or property to be overridden in a derived (child) class.

Why do we need virtual?
------------------------

It helps in polymorphism, allowing child classes to modify the behavior of methods from the parent class.

Example: Virtual Method

class Animal
{
    public virtual void MakeSound()  // üëà virtual method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()  // üëà overriding the virtual method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Animal myAnimal = new Dog();  
        myAnimal.MakeSound();  // Output: Dog barks. ‚úÖ
    }
}

Breaking it down:

MakeSound in Animal is marked as virtual, meaning it can be changed in child classes.
Dog overrides MakeSound, providing its own version.
When we call MakeSound() on an Animal reference holding a Dog object, the overridden Dog version runs!

Without virtual?
-----------------

If we remove virtual, then Dog cannot override MakeSound(), and the base class version will always be called.


class Animal
{
    public void MakeSound()  // ‚ùå Not virtual
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public void MakeSound()  // ‚ùå This is just a new method, not overriding
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
        myAnimal.MakeSound();  // Output: Animal makes a sound. ‚ùå Not the overridden one!
    }
}

Since there's no virtual, the base class method runs instead of the Dog version.

Key Points:

‚úÖ Virtual methods allow overriding in derived classes
‚úÖ The override keyword must be used in the child class
‚úÖ If a method is not virtual, it cannot be overridden
‚úÖ Polymorphism works properly with virtual methods


Q: so to use polymorphism to use parent class methods and change it according to the child class needs we must use virtual type mehtod in the parent class, is that right?

A: 

Yes! You must use the virtual keyword in the parent class if you want child classes to be able to override the method and change its behavior.

Without virtual, the method in the parent class cannot be overridden in the child class, and polymorphism won't work as expected.

Key points:

‚úÖ Use virtual in the parent class if you want child classes to override the method;.
‚úÖ Use override in the child class to provide a new implementation.
‚úÖ This allows polymorphism, meaning the correct method runs based on the object type at runtime.
