Delegates and Asynchronous Method Calls – Explained Simply 🚀
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In C#, delegates can be used to call methods asynchronously (meaning they run in the background while the program continues executing). This is useful when dealing with long-running tasks like file downloads, database operations, or network requests

1️⃣ How Does It Work?
_____________________

Normally, when you call a method, your program waits for it to finish before moving to the next line.
With asynchronous delegates, the method runs in the background, and your program can continue executing other tasks without waiting.

📝 Steps to Call a Method Asynchronously Using a Delegate

1. Create a delegate that represents a method.
2. Call the method asynchronously using BeginInvoke().
3. (Optional) Get the result later using EndInvoke().

2️⃣ Example: Running a Method Asynchronously
________________________________________

Let’s say we have a method that takes 5 seconds to execute. Instead of blocking the program, we run it asynchronously using a delegate.

🔹 Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Execution
🔴 Without Async (Blocking Execution)

using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static void LongRunningTask()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Task started...");
        Thread.Sleep(5000);  // Simulating a long-running task (5 seconds)
        Console.WriteLine("Task completed!");
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting program...");
        
        // Call the method normally (blocks execution)
        LongRunningTask();

        Console.WriteLine("Program finished.");
    }
}


🛑 Output (Synchronous)

Starting program...
Task started...
(Task takes 5 seconds to complete)
Task completed!
Program finished.


✅ Running the Method Asynchronously Using a Delegate

We modify the code so that LongRunningTask runs asynchronously, allowing the program to continue.

using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    // Define a delegate that matches the method signature
    delegate void LongTaskDelegate();

    static void LongRunningTask()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Task started...");
        Thread.Sleep(5000);  // Simulating a long-running task
        Console.WriteLine("Task completed!");
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting program...");

        // Create a delegate instance
        LongTaskDelegate longTask = new LongRunningTask();

        // Call the method asynchronously
        longTask.BeginInvoke(null, null);

        Console.WriteLine("Program finished. (Task is still running in the background)");
    }
}

✅ Output (Asynchronous)

Starting program...
Program finished. (Task is still running in the background)
Task started...
(Task takes 5 seconds to complete)
Task completed!


✔ Benefit: The program does NOT freeze for 5 seconds. It continues execution while the task runs in the background

3️⃣ Getting the Result After the Async Task Completes
_____________________________________________

If the method returns a value, we can use EndInvoke() to retrieve it after the task completes.

🔹 Example: Asynchronous Method with Return Value


using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    // Delegate with return type
    delegate int LongTaskDelegate(int seconds);

    static int LongRunningTask(int seconds)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Task started... will take {seconds} seconds.");
        Thread.Sleep(seconds * 1000);
        Console.WriteLine("Task completed!");
        return seconds * 2; // Return some result
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting program...");

        // Create a delegate instance
        LongTaskDelegate longTask = new LongRunningTask();

        // Call method asynchronously
        IAsyncResult asyncResult = longTask.BeginInvoke(5, null, null);

        Console.WriteLine("Program finished. (Task is still running in the background)");

        // Get the result after completion
        int result = longTask.EndInvoke(asyncResult);
        Console.WriteLine($"Task result: {result}");
    }
}


4️⃣ Modern Approach: Using Task Instead of Delegates
______________________________________________

Using BeginInvoke() and EndInvoke() is considered old style in modern C#. Instead, we use Task and async/await.

🔹 Example: Using Task.Run() Instead of Delegates


using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static void LongRunningTask()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Task started...");
        Thread.Sleep(5000);
        Console.WriteLine("Task completed!");
    }

    static async Task Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting program...");

        // Run method asynchronously
        Task task = Task.Run(() => LongRunningTask());

        Console.WriteLine("Program finished. (Task is still running in the background)");

        await task; // Wait for the task to complete
    }
}


✔ Why Use Task?

More modern (recommended in .NET 5+).
Easier to manage multiple async operations.
Better performance.
