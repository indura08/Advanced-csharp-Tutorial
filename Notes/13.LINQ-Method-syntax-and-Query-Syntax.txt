1️⃣ What is Query Syntax?
------------------------

Looks like SQL (Structured Query Language).

Uses from, where, select, etc. (like a SQL query).

Easier to read if you're used to SQL queries.

Example:

var employeesInIT = from emp in employees
                    where emp.Department == "IT"
                    select emp;

📝 Think of it like writing an SQL query inside C#!

2️⃣ What is Method Syntax?
-----------------------

Uses LINQ methods like Where(), Select(), OrderBy(), etc.

Looks like method chaining in C#.

More flexible and often preferred by developers.

✅ Example of Method Syntax:

var employeesInIT = employees.Where(emp => emp.Department == "IT");

📝 Think of it as calling a bunch of C# methods one after another!
